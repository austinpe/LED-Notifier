LED Notifier by Austin Philipp-Edmonds

For Hardware instructions the following tutorial can be used as a rough guide
until I upload my own:

http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-24X6-LED-matrix/

For grooveshark install the userscript

For foobar install the foobar http control.
Some tweaks are needed to the code - the plugin provided pulls the title of the page.
So adjust the script so the title of the window is what you want displayed.

I will upload the android app when it's finished
but you need to set up your own server using Tiny WebDB by google.
